## A Graph theoretic approach for spatial connectivity analysis of Building Information Models
### Department of Architecture | RWTH Aachen University | Design Computation | CAAD

This research project aims to develop an efficient framework for analysing spatial configuration topology from Building Information Models (BIMs) by representing relations between primitive building elements as a graph. The main objective is to represent and analyse room adjacency in floor plans. To achieve this, a methodological approach for extracting wall connectivity data from IFC files is proposed. The obtained information, such as wall axis geometry, is usually present in all IFC building models and thus no custom Model View Definition (MVD) is required. Because of this, spatial relations can also be retrieved from building projects that do not meet specific Exchange Requirements for entities and properties from the IFC Schema, such as spaces and spatial boundaries. This functionality can be utilised for various design goals. For example,  inferring relevant information for energy analysis, e.g., specifying which walls are external and which internal, emergency path planning, automatic room type categorisation and many others.
